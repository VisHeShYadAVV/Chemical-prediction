#Solubility-Prediction-ML

Solubility Prediction Model
This machine learning model predicts the solubility (logS) of chemical compounds using Linear Regression and Random Forest. The model is trained on molecular descriptor data and evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score. This project demonstrates regression techniques and their applications in drug discovery and chemical analysis. ðŸš€
